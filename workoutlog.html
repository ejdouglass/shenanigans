Ok, login works, and seems to work beautifully right now. Hopefully I don't break it.
...
Anyway, next up! Data manipulation. Nerdy stuff. Essentially I really need to figure out:
	- What all needs to go in the database, now and growing into the future
	- Give the user ways to meaningfully interact with the information they can have access to
	- Put up appropriate safeguards, whether in restricting user input or sanitizing it, for when it passes back into the DB
	- Make some scripts that run so that periodically update the DB in an intelligent way (saving user data so that a crashed page isn't
		an absurdly big setback)
	- And, of course, figure out how to store potentially large blocks of "zipped" or compressed information (via my own clever shorthands
		or by some built-in means, if applicable), and make a server-side script that decompresses and delivers this information in
		coherent fashion into merrily waiting client-side variables.
	- NOTE: Just looked up a few Googled terms for compressing variables for database use. Nothing generic came up, so backburner for now.

Right now the loaded workouts are pretty silly simple: just lots of reps. Just gotta track my reps, BRO!
	- Basic interface: display my different exercises is an easy-to-click fashion. Click an exercise, click up some reps, click back out.
		OR
	Click to highlight, click below to tally up some reps, click back to neutral or click to another exercise.

Database Design: PP
Execution notes:


Drafting notes:
ENCODING for EXERCISE MADNESS
- First rule I'm self-imposing: either make everything predictable-length, minimizing the need for functions to read and figure out how to parse
	- OR -
		Include a leading number that indicates number of spaces to read, which will allow the counter to just grab variables and jump blocks quickly
- mm/dd/yyyy, stored literally or compressed:
	YEAR as a number starting with some arbitrary starting time such as 2016 + 0-a-z (1-26, covering us up until 2042 :P)
	MONTH and DAY as 01 through zz (almost 1300 possibilities, easily accounting for the entire year)
	- I think more important than any of that, though, is to make sure every data value has the same exact predictable length in the DB string...
	that will allow the decoding script to just blissfully chunk away everything into a giant array without any extra calculation
- type of workout (traditional sets'n'reps in sequence, supersets, accrued volume, AMRAP, EMOTM, ___ ... gotta eventually make slots for all of em)
	My scratch-math indicates that if you use two numbers/letters (UBERHEX) to indicate the exercise (i.e. bd, ap, whatever, starting with 00 to zz), you have a total of 
	almost 1300 different combinations - hopefully plenty.

ALSO, it would be Super Grand if we had a "quick access" portion of the DB that accounts for stuff the user is likely to look at first.
	- Today, the last week, the current cycle overall, probably first and foremost; this data should be accessed first, and will be a relatively small amount of data
	- Since this will eventually be resposnible for storing months and even potentially years' worth of data, this intel can be sorted in separate columns,
		which can grow a little dustier from disuse.
... hm, I think it'd be possible, given that the currentuser's variables are global, I could have a function that either sequentially pulls information at predictable
	intervals (like grab the most important stuff immediately, secondary stuff in 2.5 seconds, etc.), or if I want to be more precise about it all, have a rolling
	interval function that goes deeper every time more information is available, i.e. checks currentuser for username, ok cool we got that, then it keeps checking currentuser
	for next-level stuff like the current day's workouts or something, cool cool, then another set of variables covers more historical or esoteric information; the interval
	will finally clear once all that data is loaded piecemeal
		- BIG ASSUMPTION: this all assumes just grabbing the whole dang thing is slow, so start by just grabbing the whole dang thing in the code, then during testing time, 
		try filling the database with as much information as you can... copy-paste, two hundred "people" with six months of all doing identical workouts :P... and see if that
		substantially hampers the access time, and if it looks UX-injuringly sluggish, think about the above implementation

TANGENT: For stuff like events, where I can't necessarily predict the length of data available in the event, maybe making more copious use of escape characters? Ponder that later.


** DISCOVERY ** : The 65k byte restriction is from the aggregate of the entire row. This means I'll need either BLOB, LONGTEXT, and/or separate tables per month, which I'm leaning towards.
	Since this will necessitate having each month of each year be its own table, when people plan workout regimens that last for several weeks (4+), it'll necessarily bleed into
		months they can't access yet. As such, the "workout plan viewer" needs to be its own thing... JUST a viewer, since you can't edit for days past your current, but with hooks
		in it so that you can see/access at-a-glance info about workouts that you've done so far, and click down for details.

And some parts of the 'world' will need to have their own variables, which can merrily live in their own table.
GRATITUDE ; 'FORUMS,' which consists of Post ID, username, message, timestamp, etc. ; TENET'S AVAILABLE READINGS? ; TRIBES/CLANS ; 


Note, for this or for future/DP stuff, I can have a variable in the "standalone" table that can be "scripts to run" or something, and add a check to every login.
	Theoretically this would allow me to just slide in and slide out extra changes without actually having to fundamentally change JS code.

Old stuff below. Might make a more potent version of this later.
Basically, being able to pull up a handy calendar-type thing for people to use to set start dates would be neat...
Though a lot of stuff will be "start today!", which can be handled by pretty straightforward time/date functionality.
