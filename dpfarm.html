NOTES! IDEAS! SPITBALLS!
	- When you plant a thing, it goes into a tile with a new Date(). Locked in time forevermore! Growing is measured against this starting point.
	- Stuff that affects plant growth: weather, soil, original seed
	- Critters! Chickens, goats, sheep, cows, horses, ___
	- Gotta feed the critters. Some do better with various levels of interaction, as well.
	- Threats: predators, thieves, bad weather
