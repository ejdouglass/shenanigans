HYPES

You are what you eat! You've heard that before, right?

Aside from the looming threat that you'll someday spontaneously become a person pizza, its wisdom is simple:
	[ You are defined by what you consume. ]

The food that you eat affects how you feel, and over time, is literally what you're made of and the shape your body takes.

Turns out we're a hodgepodge of of everything we consume (or fail to). Your successes, your failures, your friends, your families, the information you expose yourself to, the exercise you
	do or don't do... your very soul is shaped by what you interact with, how often, and how intensely.

The Playground is a buffet FOR YOUR LIFE: a world of helpful, easy-to-understand fitness and lifestyle goodness wrapped in an interactive narrative driven by your own goals and lofty dreams
	for yourself. This means that wherever you're coming from, the Playground will meet you where you are today, and it will provide an ongoing Choose-Your-Own-Adventure filled with
	colorful charcters, wacky adventures, interesting stories, and lots of other good stuff I should elaborate on pretty soon here.
Add: "your body and your adventure transforms the world of the playground and opens new paths for you to explore and master"

It is the result of YOUR input, years of experience, much learning, etc. A community that will keep you motivated and informed! Woo!

And you unlock stuff! Badges and stuff! THE WORLD ITSELF! More story! More areas! What does this really mean? More skills! More exercise! You get better with encouragement at your own pace
	never feeling lost or confused, always inspired, always with a way to grow and see the evidence of that and show off your goodz.

It's physical, but it is also mental and emotional. All aspects of your well-being and human existence can be explored here, if you so choose. But you won't be overwhelmed! Newp. Some
	people like to travel broadly and dig deeply, while others want to jump in and follow along. And y'all may change your style between the two. It's your experience, and the
	Playground will adjust to your needs and expectations. NEAT.

List of features? HM! BULLETS! Bang bang.
-) The Great Battery
-) Modular workouts responsive to where you're at and what you want with an easy fun interface
-) Monthly events and challenges to get you engaged and be super success-person
-) Tribebuilding features allowing you to bond over your favorite whatever as you march your way to collective victory
-) 

Inertia, momentum, and habit can either be your greatest foe or your greatest ally. Lock it in here.

"Say I'm in. How does it work specifically and what does it look like when I start?"
- Grow muscle, minimize unnecessary bodyfat, ensure healthy human range on all your joints. Figure out where you're weak, address it. Figure out where you're being drained, plug those 
	holes. Build your community, explore your capacities, and start your adventure.
- Easy-peasy handy features: daily battery (called something else), rituals, community, workout tracking, ...

NOTE: Shrink the HECK out of the stuff below, condense, and make it AWESOME-sauce.
Well, a good place to start is your health. [Self: “Health” is so generic and over-used you may want to phrase it differently.] If you don’t know what’s a good place to begin, make the world a better place by making YOUR world a better place. Your quality of life, the sharpness of your mind and your energy and your attention and your love and everything is housed in your physical frame. So, absent anything else, you start with you.
1. Aerobic capacity (including breathing)
2. Right amount of nutrition and water
3. Muscle mass
4. Body fat/hormonal profile
5. Stress and recovery (including sleep, attitude, behavior)
6. Connection/belonging
7. Range of Motion (including removing restrictions)
8. Expression

We gots several types of high intensity training, basic gymnastic-style training, bodyweight stuff basically, yoga stuff, covering strength training, cardio, stretchies, full-body, 
	splits, all the things!

The “basic” 30-minute, 6-day approach: push, pull, leg. Simple, easy to follow, easy to progress, easy to plan for, goes anywhere you do, and over time will give you incredibly good results without taking over your life. Just as importantly, the “easy” positive momentum that you gain from this will leech over into other parts of your life, making you more active, optimistic, confident, and sexy as hell.

(BODYWEIGHT is our vessel. Gotta talk about that too. Probably way earlier than this. :P)

From below: What is your FRAME? What are you WILLING to do? We help you frame and reframe. If you’re not willing, you won’t succeed. Here there are tricks to help you become willing! Also, realize that there’s a bare minimum to make positive progress, and it’s far less than you think. This ain’t a bootcamp! We can work with that, and work to make more and more happen over time.

You never know when doubt attacks, so the Playground will help you make sure you're prepared. Something to staple to your eyeballs. For realsies.

In-depth tutorials on EVERYTHING. The Three Points at every level: you always know exactly what you need to do to achieve mastery at each level while you get cool sneak peeks at all
	the stuff you're building up to. And you define your building-to. But we'll help with that, too!

Honest, useful, fun, practical/actionable, accessible.

Doing it every day PROVES it's important to you. The positive feedback loop.

You are the sum total of the stories that you hear and the stories that you tell. PrPL puts you in charge of that narrative.

[Execution Scribbles]

META REQS AND IDEAS:
	- Define exercise attributes (a wide list of variables that are assigned to each exercise, as below)
	- Untried exercises have a certain color and appearance?
	- Practiced exercises can vary from orange (oh geez this is hard, sparing or careful practice) to yellows to greens (easy-peasy, MAYBE conditioning level) to little boy
		blue (so stupidly below walkaround strength levels and mastery that they're basically mobility or activation exercises only)
	- Almost-there exercises are greyed out... just a little further!
	- Yoga poses/stretches/etc. might have a different appearance altogether, such as purple, and don't get put into the general exercise pool
	- So there's user data, lurking in the DB/JS, and fixed data, lurking in... let's say the server-side scripts.
		- User data: historical workout data, current attributes, current workout and goals and restrictions, stuff like that
		- Fixed data: big ol' slab of data holding all the exercises and the variables of theirs that don't ever change
	- The fixed data can be retrieved immediately without worrying about anything else; just scoot it all to a big ol' JS variable
		- This can just be a simple .php script that's just run with app load and pours its little heart out in a simple one-way operation
	- User data can be imported separately?


EACH EXERCISE NEEDS TO HOLD:
	- Video Reference
	- Execution Reference (written, maybe illustrated simply)
	- Dynamic (reps) or static (held)
	- Yoga Y/N (a quick switch that defines stuff that really falls into the realm of stretching/breathing/awareness holds)
	- Tools required (basically default is bodyweight, which is essentially do-anywhere, vs. rings or pull-up source)
	- Purpose outline (i.e. mobility 9, strength 5, etc. ; weighed against user attributes below to determine suitability for different workout purposes)
	- Types (gross motor type, sub-patterns such as gait, any other families it could belong to)
	- Exercise Attributes (i.e. quad power 5, single leg balance 3, knee torque 2, hip power under flexion 9, etc.)
	- Suitability factors (sufficient strength, mobility, etc. based on general and specific assessments)
	- USER: Current mastery level
		- Don't know 'til ya try! So different look for un-practiced versus practiced exercises.
	- USER: Suitability
		- Basically an overlay that looks at user attributes & current restrictions vs. exercise's and lights up as green to red to greyed out, with different meanings to each
	- USER: Purpose Attributes (i.e. mobility, strength, endurance, HIIT, etc.)
		- This is a derived attribute based on the user's stats; an exercise that's a total strength-builder for one is a mobility drill for another



CURRENT WORKOUT HOLDS...
	- Number of different workouts (i.e. 3 workouts: push, pull, legs)
		- Number of exercises

8-25-17 Jefric Calendar Sketch

So workoutlog.js and dblogin.php basically have all the goodies we need for the login part. Cool!

The main challenge right now from my perspective is that we need to store potentially lots of always-growing data, including user-defined data, saved and accessible by date.
	- I've surmised that this wouldn't work well in the main user data table. Another table would probably be best.
	- Actually, I'm not sure if there's a limit on number of tables, but every unique month could have its own table. Or every year. Month would be safer, as a year
		could potentially be a LOT of data. Maybe.
	- It'd be easy enough to either manually create a new table when necessary, OR have a responsive script that generates a new month table on a needs basis.

Ok. So. Login. Got it. Pull calendar data. Load the current day/week/goal data into the page. Any saved changes are synced to the DB immediately.
	- The DB change saves can be a full overwrite of all calendar data? Hm.
Every unique month (month-year) will have its own table. Within each table will have the userID for each row, and days (date and day) in columns.
	- Each day is in charge of storing all goals, progress towards goals, etc.
	- NOTE: Accomplishments for major events and characters are stored with them, not in the general calendar, to expedite access.

One challenge for implementation is "30 day goals" and such. How do we track those? How do we save those? Since tables are split up by month...
I might have to have even more tables for that! :P Possibly just an "archive" table that saves stuff like this plus other unique historical data?
	- Another option may be to parse/save the time data in such a way that the PHP/JS has access to stuff in an ongoing "Day 1, Day 2, etc." kind of way.
		That is, your entire history is laid out in a long array, with each day containing the proper intel. So, it could all sit merrily in the calendar tables as-is, 
		but when it is retrieved, you pull it out in such a way that you gain a much greater accessibility to it.
		- Additional strength to this: if you're smart about storing this way, you can already have stuff saved into the current day where it'll already know that
		you're on "Day 17 of 30" or whatever of a current campaign. 

So the onus, then, is to build a system that will scale well - since I'll be striving to save daily data in a way that will be permanently accessible and legible to future code.

Every day will have to save a full battery of stuff. Everything everybody can do per day! Some of it will be user-generated, thus cannot be truncated.
	- In some cases, you can set a character maximum.
	- In other cases, like gratitude journaling, we're probably looking at a separate table? Maybe?

Either way. For the Jefric Calendar, not only do we have user-defined goals by description, but we also need daily commentary that's easily accessible, and we also need 
	user-defined metrics. Unlike "easier" or more predictable sets-and-reps-or-holds that exercises have, the user needs to be able to define either a numeric goal or a
	binary goal (yes/no/partial). And maybe have the daily commentary require some self-reflection. "You're way behind your goal. What's holding you back?" But maybe
	more specific, asking more useful questions.

Dang! Complicated. But I don't think we need all of this for the Jefric Calendar; just build with this in mind. Start with a foundation. Go from there.
