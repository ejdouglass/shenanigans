	Right around here... GROUP STUFF!
	Functionalities: [My Groups] [Find a Group] [Make a New Group]
	- ) My Groups: default functionality upon tab load, lists the groups you're part of; it'd also be good if we can get to these in a single click, maybe from the greeting/idtag?
	- ) Find a Group: by default just lists X groups; advanced option is to have a search bar that queries by group name; clickable filters to narrow down results
	- ) Make a New Group: 
	[groups] : id (auto-increment), members (with permissions), in-group shared attributes, privacy level/listing level, groupgoal, groupgoaltimeframe (start/end/measurement-timing)

RIGHT NAO:
- Make "Make a Group" work. Like, at all - just make it make a thing in the database. Creator automatically gets maximum privileges.
	- Extra: "Search for Group" functionality, which lists all groups OR all groups by goal OR some other potential metrics
	- "Create Group Goal" in 
- Implement "My Goals" functionality for personal account. Include ability ... I trailed off here and don't remember what I was gonna say. :P
		- Button: "Add A Goal!" : tab-types incl. Body, Mind, etc. ... form-define each as daily, until-defeated, whatnot

9/11/17
We got an agreement with JOOF to get some shit done this week. So! What are we building? What's it gotta do?
- ) Login page ... with login and cookies! (We already built that stuff. Woo! And it's already functioning, justwithin jecalendar specifically.)
- ) Successful login = fire up the calendar! (CALENDARMODE ... activate! ... won't always be the first MODE active)
	- akshully ... GROUP is the focus. Since Calendar is personal. Groups reference personal versions of, but don't have their own, calendar. For now.
- ) Grab ALL THE DATA and slip it into the user's object.
	- critical point: what is ALL THE DATA? ... we must also be ready to cull the relevant group data
	- akshully again... the bulk of activity will be in the calendar tables, so just grab and smoosh those, right?
	- don't really know how to handle "comments" and such at this point
	- so maybe for now, groups are just a way to cross-reference goals
IDEA! Maybe the calendar tables... immense and powerful! ... have TWO id types, personal and group! So group messages can chill in the calendar tables too!
	- normal ID numbers are as expected...
	- group ID numbers saved in as "g" + group id, meaning we have to be sure that we're in VARCHAR mode and not INT for this column now...

Moving right along. So! Use the previous code to enable login functionality.
- Once you're logged in, all your data is pulled. Yay! Including all group data? All recent group data, anyway.
- GROUP functionality... when you navigate to the group, we need to pull something useful. "Today's Activity," "This Week's Activity," etc.

"MAKE A GROUP!"
- Start date, end date, measuring period (optional, such as weekly, work-weekly, etc.)

NOTE: uname will be your public face, unless you create a "pseudonym" to go by. Currently there are no special requirements or rules for this.


DATABASE tables...
[PGPeeps] : id (auto-increment), uname, pword, groups, rank, firstname, lastname, pseudonym, email, tier, reg_date, friends, questlog, playarea, settings
[groups] : id (auto-increment), members (with permissions), framework/grouptype, privacy level/listing level, groupgoal, groupgoaltimeframe (start/end/measurement-timing)
[September2017] : id, day1, day2, etc. 
... each NPC will have their own table, which we can grab at later. Just a mental note. Well, actual note, I guess. :P

What's the easiest way to retrieve ALL calendar data for someone? We have their reg_date already.


////////

Ok. We want to be able to cross-link accounts for different objectives. We'll have a Jefric cross (life goals) and a Rosemereff weight-loss cross.
	- I think ... GROUPS table? New table is created when a group is created? Or a single GROUPS table that holds everything?
	- Ok, if a GROUPS table, then ID for each group as primary key, and CORE DATA can include a GROUPS column to indicate which groups everyone is a member of.
		- This shouuuuuld work ... since everything is user-driven, viewing and editing will pull through your data.
		- The other side of this is when you're looking through old commentary, how do you access "Bob Jones (dd/mm/yy): Blah blah blah."
		We can't easily store all this data client-side... hm... "CLIENT042 TIMESTAMP" may save more readily? 42xTIMESTAMPxMESSAGE?

GROUP data:
	- Member list
	- Core message
	- Any core mechanics... like countdown to a certain date, individual data points (daily/weekly calories, activities)
		- Dangass. This can get awfully complicated! Careful.
		- OR! Or or or. Or. Or.
			What if.
			Everyone has their own daily calendars of activities, right?
			So give everyone tools to track what-the-fuck-ever they want. Be robust! Easy-peasy. And groups are for communication... messages. And stats are shared automatically from CALENDARS.
			Meaning.
			When you look at a group, it does a search through all members' 
				... daily...
				... data...
				... within the group goal range.
				Holy shit.
				Um.
				That's actually a lot.
				Huh.
				MAYBE we can do a little algorithm based on the goals and just "archive" it somewhere in the group so that, say, "rolling daily calories" just gets saved
					rather than live-computed from everybody's whatever.
				Also, we can consider using web workers? Is that a thing? Like, collect the gritty data in the background, because it's not the most critical info. Or
					every time you check in... maybe actually hit a "Check In!" button or something... it updates your rolling data, and just saves that.

SO, first thing: make calendar data. Every month has its own table. Saves everything for everyone for a given month. A script can pull it out and parse it into coherency,
	and once it's coherent, JSON it into the client. We want to minimize database access and separate calls, so maybe a blind ham-handed grab of data, and then parse it from there?

You log in. It pulls for you the current date and time upon login. This isn't a constant; just a way for the client to pull up today's current data from the MESS O INFO.
	- Every time you update, it assumes you're updating for TODAY, but there should be a handy easy widget to "jump to" another day.

IDEA: Emergency table creation... when someone logs in and runs a basic retrieval script, maybe a VERY quick run against a table for that date.
	- That is to say, if it's September 1st, and there's no September 2017 table yet (uh oh!), throw up a quick script to fix that.
	- Alternatively, we can do it on upload/update ... when selecting date(s) to update, if they ain't there, make 'em.
		- Which is best? I dunno. We want this to be an "oops" thing, and it's probably best if we just pre-populate all foreseeable months running up to a year ahead.
		- Thus, maybe just an exception handler when we update. Figure out how to check during the update, and do something fancy if we encounter a problem there.

CREATE GOALGROUP
	- Different types (you can tag weightloss to autoadd the calorie-tracker features, for example, as well as automatic easy-links to all top relevant articles and shit)


BUILDREQ: 
	< ) Something that culls ALL historical data into a script, and then parses it. Basically, the login script... whether manually or when you refresh/reload/navigate to the page with cookie... needs to grab ALL lifetime data for app usage. The app itself can sort it and yield effective goodies for the user.
	< ) A calendar-viewer: something to take all that juicy calendar data and "draw" the appropriate calendars.
		- Basically takes the "id 0 day 1" info out of a given table and uses those variables to quickly sketch-a-calendar.
	< ) Groupmaker interface: based on permissions and possibly a reserve of uses, generate a group
		- Easy invites (by name or by id)
		- Setup purpose, startup messages, proper chunks of customization
	< ) Son of Sephos: Beta
		- Define core content for 9/8
		- Brainstorm database access, client/browser load (which will be predominant), as well as quick/reasonable/efficient ways to access the server for multiplayer
		- "Scripting characters" and both full-NPC (guildleaders) and half-NPC (other "players")
		- Core skills/mechanics/areas


CORE DATA(base)
	- For current goals and goal-groups, some information will be flagged as 'critical,' thus will be prompted on a daily basis.
		- Example: weight loss will prompt daily request for calories consumed

PROG-JECT SKETCH (mostly from BUILDREQ)
Son of Sephos
	- See sonofsephos.html
Groupmaker
	- Choose category of group to make (such as weight loss), each of which automatically populates some core mechanics (such as daily calorie count)
	- Invitation (by name, ideally)
	- Setting permissions (thus, easy list of current members, quick clicks)
	- Basic message board mechanics; "main feed"
	- At-a-glance personal progress, as well as at-a-glance: team progress, other member progress (in some fashion - this may mean some indication of rolling progress, it may mean generally tracking activity and responsiveness, etc.)
Calendar Viewer
	- Each calendar has its builder data baked in. Cool! Start day, final day, month length. Use that to build a calendar.
	- Calendar should be the better part of the page in size. Click a day, get its deets. Though many buttons (like daily to-do) will just default to "today," and you can have a little thumbnail in the corner where you click it to bring up the proper-sized calendar. 
	- So, maybe build a "blank" calendar that gets filled in (or refilled in) with the appropriate data.
		- Is it live? Any need to check the server again, or can we go with whatever the client has already been given?
		- Either way, when you make a change, you want it reflected in the DB. Maybe forced saves and intermittent autosaves.
